# Variable Descriptions

In the thesis, both lagged and contemporaneous variables were discussed. To reduce redundancy, the tables describe the monthly variables involved in creating the preprocessed dataset for analysis in this thesis. These monthly variables served as the basis for calculating lagged values, which were generated by aggregating data over 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month periods, as specified in the table (see "Aggregate Function" column). For contemporaneous variables, the column displays a "-", indicating that their value on the reference date was utilised. The data type of each monthly and contemporaneous variable is also provided.

Notably, although the original monthly variable may be binary, the lagged version can become continuous depending on the aggregation method applied (e.g., sum).
